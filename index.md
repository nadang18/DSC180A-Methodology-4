**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic we have covered in the domain this quarter is the task of optimizing dispatching of field technicians for servicing. The steps and process of a job life cycle turns out to be more intricate than I had expected, with work spanning from different teams and departments. 

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
A potential investigation I would like to pursue for my Q2 Project is to develop a system that could handle job assignments distribution, while also optimizing such distribution to its most efficient way. 

**3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
A potential change I would make from my Q1 Project, going into my Q2 Project, is to have better definition of utilization rate, or work efficiency metrics before developing my system. In my Q1 Project, some metrics that were defined might have been off in calculation, thus refining such metrics can allow me to expand the project further.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
A technique that I'm also interested in using for my project is to expand on the topic and perhaps build a predictor model. Using our vast data from job trends and assignments, we can build a predictor model to forecast potential job counts to better handle worker distribution and improve upon utilization rate.
